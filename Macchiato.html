	  <p class="left1">Macchiato Ingredients:
	  <br><br>
		The term "macchiato" means "marked" in Italian, and the drink is all about marking the espresso or the milk:<br><br>
		Espresso Macchiato (Traditional):<br>
		Espresso: A shot of concentrated coffee.<br>Foamed Milk: A small dollop or spoonful of foamed milk placed on top of the espresso. This "marks" the espresso.<br><br><br>
		Sometimes, a touch of caramel drizzle is added to a Caramel Macchiato, which is often closer to a flavored latte macchiato.<br><br><br>
		
		What's Good About a Macchiato:<br><br>
		Bold Espresso Flavor with a Touch of Creaminess: You get the full intensity and nuanced flavors of espresso, softened ever so slightly by the small amount of milk foam. It's for those who appreciate espresso but want just a hint of creaminess.<br>
		Higher Espresso-to-Milk Ratio: If you prefer a stronger coffee flavor compared to lattes or cappuccinos, this is a great choice.<br>
		Simple and Direct: It's a no-fuss drink that highlights the quality of the espresso.
