      <h3>Latte</h3>
      <p>Smooth espresso meets velvety steamed milk, topped with a delicate whisper of foam. Often enjoyed with a touch of sweet flavor, it's also a refreshing iced treat.</p>

	  <p class="left1">Latte Ingredients:
	  <br><br>
		Made with two primary ingredients:<br>
		Espresso: A concentrated shot of coffee, providing the foundational rich flavor.<br>Steamed Milk: Milk that has been heated and aerated, creating a smooth, velvety texture. Typically, a latte has significantly more steamed milk than a cappuccino.<br>Thin Layer of Foam: A small amount of microfoam (finely textured steamed milk) graces the top. The foam layer is thinner compared to a cappuccino.<br><br><br>
		Often, lattes are flavored with syrups such as vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, or seasonal options. An Iced Latte simply uses chilled espresso and cold milk served over ice, sometimes with flavorings.<br><br><br>
		
		What's Good About a Latte:<br><br>
		Smooth and Creamy Texture: The high proportion of steamed milk creates a luxurious, smooth, and comforting drink. <br>
		Visually Appealing: Baristas often create latte art on the thin layer of foam, adding an aesthetic touch to the drink.<br>
		Good Source of Calcium (from milk): The milk in a latte provides a good source of calcium.
