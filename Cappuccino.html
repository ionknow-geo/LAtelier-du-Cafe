      <p>A balanced symphony of bold espresso, warm steamed milk, and a generous, airy crown of foamed milk, sometimes dusted with cocoa for an extra touch. </p>

	  <p class="left1">Cappuccino Ingredients:
	  <br><br>
		Made with three equal parts:<br>
		Espresso: A concentrated shot of coffee, forming the base flavor.<br>Steamed Milk: Milk that has been heated and aerated, giving it a smooth, slightly sweet texture.<br>Foamed Milk (Microfoam): Milk that has been vigorously aerated to create a thick, velvety foam. This sits on top of the steamed milk and espresso.<br><br><br>
		Sometimes, a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon is added as a garnish. Flavor syrups like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut can also be incorporated for a sweeter or more customized taste.<br><br><br>
		
		What's Good About a Cappuccino:<br><br>
		Balanced Flavor: The equal proportions of espresso, steamed milk, and foam create a harmonious blend where the bold coffee flavor is softened by the creamy milk, without being overwhelmed.<br>
		Pleasant Texture: The combination of smooth liquid and airy foam offers a delightful mouthfeel, making each sip an experience.<br>
		Satisfying and Not Too Heavy: Compared to a latte, the higher foam-to-milk ratio can make it feel less heavy while still providing a satisfying coffee experience.
